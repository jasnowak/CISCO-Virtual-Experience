# CISCO-Virtual-Experience
My code for the CISCO Software Engineering Virtual Experience.
The project involves creating a web based application called Sextant.
Sextant is made up of reusable React components which displays the clients public IPV4 and IPV6 addresses.
It also calculates and displays packet latency from Pylon. In order to do this it makes use of the W3C Websocket API.
